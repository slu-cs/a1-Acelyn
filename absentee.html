        <h5>How to Vote by Absentee Ballot  </h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Applications for Absentee Ballots are available at your county board of elections.</li>
          <li>You may also download a PDF version of the New York State Absentee Ballot Application Form</li>
          <li>Upon completion, applications must be mailed to your county board no later than the seventh day before the election or delivered in person no later than the day before the election.</li>
          <li>You may also request an Absentee Ballot by sending a letter to your county board of elections. The letter must be received by your county board no earlier than 30 days and no later than seven days before the election. The letter must contain the following information:
            <ul>
              <li>the address where you are registered</li>
              <li>an address where the ballot is to be sent</li>
              <li>the reason for the request, and</li>
              <li>the signature of the voter</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you apply by letter, an application form will be mailed with your ballot. The application form must be completed and returned with your ballot.</p>
            
            <p>If you cannot pick up your ballot, or will not be able to receive it through the mail, you have the right to designate someone to pick it up for you. Only that person designated on your application may pick up and deliver your ballot.</p>
          
            <p>If you are permanently ill or disabled, you have the right to receive an Absentee Ballot for each subsequent election without further application. Simply file an application with your county board of elections indicating permanent illness or physical disability. You will then automatically receive an absentee ballot for every election until your registration is canceled.</p>
