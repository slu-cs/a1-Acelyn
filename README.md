Overall comments on grading questions:

1) Does your site make the information easy to find?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - There are some typos here and there (see index.html for examples).
    - I can't find how to email the BoE.
    - The Absentee Ballot Application form is mentioned, but not linked.
    - Might make more sense to organize Absentee Voting and Early Voting under Elections rather than Voter Registration.
    - The "helpful links" shortcut nav that you have on some of the pages is nice. Consider putting these links consistently on all pages.

2) Are the pages reasonably structured with HTML?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - A couple of questionable tag choices (see index.html for examples).
    - The Voter Registration page is a little lengthy and could use a bit more internal structure.
    - The registration deadlines could be compactly represented in a table, like the one for the absentee ballot deadlines.

3) Are the pages tolerably styled with Bootstrap?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - It's nice for table headings to look a little different than table data.
    - In the side nav on the home page, the bullets don't really seem necessary, and the alignment seems a bit off.
